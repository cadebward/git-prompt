# Git Bash Completion & Branch Awareness

I searched long and hard to hack together git completion on my terminal. I also found it extremely useful to see which branch you are on in your terminal. 

`file-name branch-name branch-status$`

And example of this prompt, if you were inside of a directory called `testing`, on the branch `master`, with uncommited changes:

`testing master+$ git add .`

Feel free to change up the prompt as you wish. Enjoy :)
